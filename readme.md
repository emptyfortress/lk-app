# Прототип ЛК на базе foundation for apps (angular.js)


If you're already an Angular developer, you may instead want to install the components into your own stack using Bower: `bower install foundation-apps`

## Requirements

You'll need the following software installed to get started.

  - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer for your OS.
  - [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads): Use the installer for your OS.
    - Windows users can also try [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).
  - [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `npm install -g gulp bower`
    - Depending on how Node is configured on your machine, you may need to run `sudo npm install -g gulp bower` instead, if you get an error with the first command.
